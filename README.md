# Cricinformatics

## Introduction
Data source: https://www.kaggle.com/cclayford/cricinfo-statsguru-data/version/8# and ESPN Cricinfo

Using this curated cricket dataset, I applied a whole set of tools commonly found in bioinformatics and applied statistics to reveal interesting information buried in the data. 

## Motivation

I always love watching cricket and wonder if we can move the statistics commonly used in cricket can be improved/modernised. 

## Presentation slides

Slides for my presentation for Sydney University Mathematics Society is available [here](https://kevinwang09.github.io/cricket_analysis/assets/player/KeynoteDHTMLPlayer.html#0).


## Results


1.  Networks of batsmen were "prognostic" for Ashes team performance.
2.  Classifiability score (Strbenac et. al. 2015) of cricket players was directly correlated with well-established ternary categories of batsmen, bowlers, all-rounders.
3.  By applying Monocle, a single-cell trajectory analysis (Trapnell et. al. 2014) revealed potential career progressions and maturation of players.
